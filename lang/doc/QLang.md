## Abstract

This paper contains a definition of QLang, the problem it solves.

## What is QLang

QLang is a XML extension that allows you to create define structured test papers, QLang is a base that allows other applications to build out of this allows you to write your test paper once and make it work anywhere. 

QLang is easy, simple and open to everyone we believe that anyone can learn QLang even if they don't have prior experience computers. We believe that removing a user interface from the *author* will help them design a test paper faster.

## The problem it solves

While making QLang it was our top priority to make QLang accessible to anyone, any age, any gender, This *accessibility* was achieved by using simple words that people use every day ***like choice, correct, value, author***. We believe that QLang will help anyone to easily design test papers using computers

## Impact

We made QLang very similar to html but removing its complexities. Even when QLang is a language extension of XML we wanted it to be easy and give them an idea about programming and show them how simple programming is ***Specially to people who have never done complex tasks with a computer***. We believe that QLang will empower people to try programming.
